# Complexity-Based Test Optimization - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive complexity-based test optimization system for Minigun. This system addresses the user's request to optimize test attempt allocation based on code complexity and time budgets.

## Key Components

### 1. Complexity Analysis Module (`minigun/complexity.py`)

**Features:**
- **Static Analysis**: Calculates cyclomatic complexity, parameter count, nesting depth, and lines of code using AST analysis
- **Empirical Analysis**: Measures actual execution and generation times through sampling
- **Unified Scoring**: Combines static and empirical metrics into a single complexity score
- **Budget Allocation**: Distributes test attempts across properties based on complexity scores

**Key Functions:**
- `analyze_complexity()`: Comprehensive complexity analysis of law functions
- `calculate_complexity_score()`: Unified scoring algorithm
- `allocate_time_budget()`: Time budget distribution algorithm

### 2. Enhanced Specification System (`minigun/specify.py`)

**Enhancements:**
- Added `complexity_metrics` field to `_Prop` dataclass
- Implemented `check()` function with automatic complexity analysis
- Added budget allocation and application functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

**New Functions:**
- `analyze_spec_complexity()`: Analyze individual specifications
- `collect_prop_specs()`: Extract property specs from composite specs
- `allocate_budget_to_specs()`: Allocate attempts based on complexity
- `apply_budget_allocation()`: Apply allocations to specification tree

### 3. Symbolic Cardinality System (`minigun/cardinality.py`)

**Features:**
- **Symbolic expressions** for exact domain tracking
- **O-notation support** with automatic asymptotic pattern detection
- **Compositional cardinality** for generator combinators
- **Optimal stopping limits** using √|domain| calculations

## How It Works

### 1. Complexity Analysis Process

1. **Static Analysis**: Parse function AST to calculate structural complexity
2. **Empirical Measurement**: Run sample executions to measure timing
3. **Score Calculation**: Combine metrics into unified complexity score
4. **Normalization**: Scale scores for fair comparison across properties

### 2. Budget Allocation Algorithm

1. **Collect Properties**: Extract all property specs from composite specifications
2. **Analyze Complexity**: Perform complexity analysis on each property
3. **Calculate Proportions**: Distribute budget proportionally to complexity scores
4. **Apply Bounds**: Ensure min/max attempt constraints are respected
5. **Report Allocation**: Provide detailed breakdown of allocation decisions

### 3. Integration Strategy

The system uses a layered approach:
- **Core Functions**: New complexity analysis and budget allocation functions
- **Enhanced Interface**: `check()` now includes automatic complexity analysis
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
- **CLI Enhancement**: New options that enhance existing functionality

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Optimized Resource Allocation

- **Intelligent distribution** of test attempts based on actual complexity
- **Time budget compliance** for predictable test execution
- **Better coverage** of complex properties relative to simple ones

### 2. Improved Development Experience

- **Visible allocation decisions** help understand test suite characteristics
- **Configurable parameters** allow fine-tuning for different scenarios
- **CLI integration** makes features easily accessible

### 3. Practical Applicability

- **CI/CD friendly** with time budget controls
- **Scalable approach** that works with large test suites
- **Research foundation** for future optimization techniques

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully addresses the user's requirements:

✅ **Complexity scoring** using both static and empirical analysis
✅ **Time budget allocation** with intelligent distribution
✅ **CLI integration** for easy adoption
✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing code
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** and examples

The system provides a solid foundation for optimized property-based testing while maintaining the elegance and simplicity of the original Minigun design.
